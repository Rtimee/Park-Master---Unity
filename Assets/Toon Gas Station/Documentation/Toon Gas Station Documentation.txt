Thank you for downloading Toon Gas Station!

If you like it, pleaase review it :)

	Version 1.0:

The assets are very simple to use, just drag and drop one of the prefabs into the scene.
Objects are easy to place in the scene if you use vertex snapping, or if you use a 1x1 grid placement system.

All models come with centered pivot points at the base.

The naming convention uses the “.L” and “.R” suffixes 
for wheels and objects that may be animated on the left-hand side and right-hand side respectively.
Example: the wheel on the front right of a vehicle uses the name "Wheel_F.R”

A few assets, such buildings have lighting addons in the object hierarchy.
If you plan on using the assets during day-time light settings, you might want to disable those.

A post processing profiles is available, easy to test out in the demo scene.

Make sure to have the V2 Post Processing Stack in your project, you can enable it from the Package Manager window.
